    "Now, let us calculate the linear absorption signal that would be obtained from the interaction of our laser pulse with the molecular system we defined in section 1. A routine has been written for this, such that it is straightforward to recalculate an absorption signal with a change of parameters. In order for UFSS to read the laser field and compute its interaction with our molecular system, we need to use the <code>set_efields</code> routine, which takes as arguments the time array, envelope function, carrier frequency, and phase discrimination condition. We will pass the first three variables as arguments to the linear absorption function, whilst the latter point we have not yet considered, but will become important when we consider multiple pulses later in the practical. For now, we will simply set it equal to '+'. Furthermore, since UFSS is meant for computation of non-linear spectra with multiple pulses, it requires a set of pulse delays and times with the <code>set_pulse_delays</code> and <code>pulse_times</code> routines. For now, we only have one arriving at $t=0$. \n",

    "### 2.3 Inhomogenous Broadening\n",
    "\n",
    "For an isolated, closed, molecular system, spectra would exhibit perfectly sharp absorption lines. However, in reality they are broadened by interaction with the environment. The broadening of the lines can be seperated into two components: homogenous broadening and inhomogenous broadening. \n",
    "\n",
    "Homogenous broadening arises from three sources:\n",
    "1. Population relaxation (time constant $T_1$). Transitions have a finite lifetime associated with them, and this uncertainty in the time gives rise to an unceartainty in the energy that is the same for all molecules in the system.\n",
    "2. Pure dephasing (time constant $T_2^*$). A dynamic effect in which memory of the phase of oscillation of a molecule is lost as a result of intermolecular interactions that randomize the phase.\n",
    "3. Orientational relaxation ($\\tau_{\\text{or}}$) An ensemble averaged dephasing effect associated with the randomization of the initial dipole orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogenous broadening gives rise to a Lorentzian line shape, and is already accounted for in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inhomogenous broadening arises due to the fact that each molecule is in a slightly different environment (e.g. different solvent shell), and hence the electronic transitions all have slightly different energies due to interactions with this environment. This gives rise to a Gaussian broadening of the absorption signal. We can mimic this effect in UFSS by first setting up a number of different molecular Hamiltonians with slightly different energy levels according to a Gaussian distribution, and then computing absorption spectra for each and averaging. This is implemented in two routines below, with: 1) <code>setup_inhom</code> that creates the required UFSS objects for each calculation and the corresponding weight for each spectra, and 2) <code>inhomogeneous_broadening</code> that calculates the spectra and averages."

    "## 3. Transient Absorption\n",
    "\n",
    "Transient absorption spectroscopy is conducted by a pump laser pulse that excites a sample, and a probe laser pulse that measures the change in absorption of the sample after a time delay. It is perhaps the most straightforward of the 3rd order non-linear spectroscopies, with the generated 3rd order polarisation being detected in the same direction as the probe laser pulse, which acts as a local oscillator. In terms of the phase-matching condition, the resultant wavevector of the third order polarization $k_{\\text{sig}}$ can be expressed in terms of the wavevectors of the pump $k_{\\text{pu}}$ and probe $k_{\\text{pr}}$ pulses as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "k_{\\text{sig}} = -k_{\\text{pu}} + k_{\\text{pu}} + k_{\\text{pr}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the electric field of the pump pulse is actually providing two wavevectors simultaneously in the positive and negative directions, so that the resultant $k_{\\text{sig}}$ is in the direction of the probe, which is used as the local oscillator for detection. Depsite only using pump and probe pulses, transient absorption is still formally a 4 wave mixing technique (three waves to provide a field in the direction $k_{\\text{sig}}$, which is then emitted and detected by the local oscillator).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now illutsrate how we can compute this within UFSS, implemented in the function below <code>calculate_transient_absorption</code>. For simplicity, we have chosen the pump and probe pulses to have the same Gaussian profile and carrier frequency. Important points to note in the below are in the following lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <code>spec_obj.set_efields([t]\\*4,[A]\\*4,[c]\\*4,['-','+','+'])</code> : Similar to the previously illustrated linear absorption routine, this sets the electric fields and phase matching condition within UFSS. First the time array, envelope function and central carrier frequencies are passed - in this case each of them is multiplied by 4 since we have 4 electric fields we need to define. We also define the envelope function within this routine, by passing the standard deviation for the Gaussian pulse as a parameter <code>sigma</code>. The definition of the envelope function is the same as written earlier in the practical. Finally <code>['-','+','+']</code> sets the phase matching condition, equivalent to $ -k_{\\text{pu}} + k_{\\text{pu}} + k_{\\text{pr}}$.\n",
    "*  <code>spec_obj.set_pulse_delays([np.array([0]),delay_times])</code> Sets the delay time for the pulses. Only two variables are passed, time 0 for the pump pulse, and a sequence of delay times for the probe pulse.\n",
    "* <code>spec_obj.set_polarization_sequence(['x']*4)</code> Defines all the pulses to have $x$ direction polarization - i.e. in the same direction as our dipole moments.\n",
    "* The final two lines of the routine perform an isotropic averaging of the spectral signal - assuming a random distribution of molecules in the labarotory frame.\n",
    "* The returned signal is of the form $S^{(3)}(t_{\\text{pump}},t_{\\text{probe}},\\omega_{\\text{detect}})$, and therefore given as a 3 dimensional numpy array. The first dimension is equal to the dimension of the pump times passed to <code>spec_obj.set_pulse_delays</code> (i.e. 1D), the second dimension is equal to that of <code>delay_times</code>, whilst the third dimension is equal to the dimension of the detection frequencies that exists in the <code>spec_obj.w</code> method, which is worked out internally by UFSS."

    "Non-linear spectral signals typically consist of contributions from different sources, such as ground state bleaching (GSB), stimulated emission (SE) and excited state absorption (ESA). As illustrated in the previous section, all of these features can appear in a 2D electronic spectrum. These photochemical pathways can be illustrated through the use of double sided Feynman Diagrams, which illustrate the influence of the laser pulses on the denisty matrix $\\rho = | \\Psi \\rangle \\langle \\Psi |$ of the system. They have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They consist of a pair of parallel vertical lines, with the left hand line representing the ket of the system and the right hand line representing the bra of the system. \n",
    "2. Time evolution proceeds upwards, and interactions with the elecric field of the laser are represented by straight arrows. \n",
    "3. Straight arrows pointing towards the bra or ket lines represent an excitation (and so increase the quantum number by 1), straight arrows pointing away from the bra or ket lines represent a de-excitation (and so decrease the quantum number by 1). \n",
    "4. If the arrow points to the right, it represents an electric field with $+k$ wavevector, and if it points to the left it represents an electric field with $-k$ wavevector.\n",
    "5. The final arrow represents emission of the polarization signal by the system and is typically shown with a different style of arrow (dashed or curved), and by convention is emitted from the ket side. It must also end in a population state (i.e. diagonal element of the density matrix).\n",
    " \n",
    "Example Feynman diagrams for GSB, SE and ESA are shown below. The incident wavevectors sum to $-k_1+k_2+k_3$ hence they correspond to the rephasing direction, and the polarization signal emitted is $k_{\\text{sig}}=k_r$. \n",

GSB and SE both have two interactions from the right, and hence should be positive, whilst ESA has one and should be negative. However, as mentioned in the previous section, the convention that UFSS follows is that used in experiment - where the signal is to be interpreted as an intensity change relative to the ground state absorption before photoexcitation. Therefore, when seperating the diagrams, we follow this convention."
